1. Installation instructions

	a. From the project directory, run ./install. This should copy
	   the files to their correct locations and rebuild the system
	b. Run shutdown -r to reboot the system

2. Testing Instructions
	a. From the project directory, run make. This will build
	   protectfile and setkeytest
	b. Run protectfile filename e key
	   This will encrypt a file and change its
	   sticky bit accordingly
	c. Use cat on the file to see its encrypted contents
	d. Use setkeytest key
	   This will set the calling users key to the specified
	   key
	e. Use cat on the file to see its unencrypted contents
	f. Use setkeytest 0
	   This will disable encryption for the user
	g. Use cat on the file to once again see its encrypted contents
	h. Run protectfile filename d key
	   This will decrypt a file and change its sticky bit
	   accordingly
	i. Use cat on the file to once again see its unencrypted contents
